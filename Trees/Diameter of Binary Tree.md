Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int diameter = 0;

    int dfs(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        int left = dfs(root->left);
        int right = dfs(root->right);

        diameter = max(diameter, left + right);

        return 1 + max(left, right);
    }

    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root);
        return diameter;
    }
};
```
